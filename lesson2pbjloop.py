# Difficulty level: Beginner

# Goal #1: Write a new version of the PB&J program that uses a while loop.  Print "Making sandwich #" and the number of the sandwich until you are out of bread, peanut butter, or jelly.

# Example:
bread = 4
peanut_butter = 3
jelly = 10
bread_start = (bread/2)
jelly_start = jelly
peanut_butter_start = peanut_butter

if bread<=peanut_butter and bread<=jelly:

	while bread>=2 and peanut_butter>=1 and jelly>=1:
		for sandwich_count in range(1,(bread/2)+1):
			print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count)
			bread=bread-2

if bread<2:
	print "All done; only had enough for {0} sandwiches.".format(bread_start)

if jelly<=peanut_butter and jelly<=bread:
	while bread>=2 and peanut_butter>=1 and jelly>=1:
		for sandwich_count in range(1,jelly+1):
			print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count)
			jelly=jelly-1

		if jelly<1:
			print "All done; only had enough for {0} sandwiches.".format(jelly_start)			

if peanut_butter<=jelly and peanut_butter<=bread:
	while bread>=2 and peanut_butter>=1 and jelly>=1:
		for sandwich_count in range(1,peanut_butter+1):
			print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count)
			peanut_butter=peanut_butter-1

		if peanut_butter<1:
			print "All done; only had enough for {0} sandwiches.".format(peanut_butter_start)		


# Output:
# Making sandwich #1
# Making sandwich #2
# All done; only had enough bread for 2 sandwiches.

# Goal #2: Modify that program to say how many sandwiches-worth of each ingredient remains.

# Example 2:
bread = 10
peanut_butter = 10
jelly = 4
bread_start = (bread/2)
jelly_start = jelly
peanut_butter_start = peanut_butter

if (bread/2)<=peanut_butter and (bread/2)<=jelly:

	while bread>3 and peanut_butter>=1 and jelly>=1:
		for sandwich_count in range(1,(bread/2)):
			print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count)
			print "I have enough bread for {0} more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for {1} more, and enough jelly for {2} more.".format((bread/2)-1, peanut_butter-1,jelly-1)
			bread=bread-2
			jelly=jelly-1
			peanut_butter=peanut_butter-1

	if bread<=3:
		print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count+1)
		print "All done; I ran out of bread."

if jelly<=peanut_butter and jelly<=(bread/2):
	while bread>=2 and peanut_butter>=1 and jelly>1:
		for sandwich_count in range(1,jelly):
			print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count)
			print "I have enough bread for {0} more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for {1} more, and enough jelly for {2} more.".format((bread/2)-1, peanut_butter-1,jelly-1)
			bread=bread-2
			jelly=jelly-1
			peanut_butter=peanut_butter-1

		if jelly<=1:
			print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count+1)
			print "All done; I ran out of jelly."

if peanut_butter<=jelly and peanut_butter<=(bread/2):
	while bread>=2 and peanut_butter>1 and jelly>=1:
		for sandwich_count in range(1,peanut_butter):
			print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count)
			print "I have enough bread for {0} more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for {1} more, and enough jelly for {2} more.".format((bread/2)-1, peanut_butter-1,jelly-1)
			bread=bread-2
			jelly=jelly-1
			peanut_butter=peanut_butter-1

		if peanut_butter<=1:
			print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count+1)
			print "All done; I ran out of peanut butter."



# Output:
# Making sandwich #1
# I have enough bread for 4 more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for 9 more, and enough jelly for 3 more.
# Making sandwich #2
# I have enough bread for 3 more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for 8 more, and enough jelly for 2 more.
# Making sandwich #3
# I have enough bread for 2 more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for 7 more, and enough jelly for 1 more.
# Making sandwich #4
# All done; I ran out of jelly.
